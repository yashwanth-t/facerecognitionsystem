Stage 1:
0) Calculate blur and set threshold value to 0.4 (Done)
1) Pickle the labels (Done)
2) Use predict prob to get the confidence and then choose the corresponding label (Done)
3) Determine accuracy manually (In progress)

Stage 2:
1) Divide SVMs into n individual models
2) Calculate face angle based on face coordinates
3) Save n labels to determine accuracy

Stage 3:
1) Compare accuracies and results
