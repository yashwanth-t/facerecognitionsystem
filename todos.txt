Stage 1:
0) Calculate blur and set threshold value to 0.4
1) Pickle the labels
2) Use predict prob to get the confidence and then choose the corresponding label
3) Determine accuracy manually

Stage 2:
1) Divide SVMs into n individual models
2) Save n labels to determine accuracy

Stage 3:
1) Compare accuracies and results
